Test Plan 

In this project, functional tests and non-functional tests are used to ensure programs can compile and work correctly. Functional tests consist of unit tests, integration tests, system tests. Non-functional tests focus on if it could run in different OS. For unit test, it would use test cases provided by me including both valid and invalid cases and check whether outputs appear in the expected way. This would be first executed just when a function can be compiled rightly to help early to catch bugs. It would be done again when each part has been finished. For integration tests, they focus on the interfaces of some functions and streaming of inputs and outputs. For system tests, the logic on how different modules combined are examined to know whether it can handle different situations in the designed way.
About test cases, it would cover maximum, minimum and boundary value of variables with numeric type. The empty value(argc, size...) is included to test the rebustness. Also, I has made map files with small size to validate the answer of output.
